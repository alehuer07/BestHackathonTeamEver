DeveloperWeek Hackathon 2020 Here 

## Inspiration 

We wanted to take ride-sharing to the next level by having people enjoy their rides and commutes through entertainment. So we thought music was a great way to get people more connected! 

## What we built
We built a web app that matches you with someone to carpool with depending on music taste as well as location and destination.

## How we built it
We used HTML/CSS for front-end with JavaScript. Node.js and Ajax were used to get the matching working server-side. We worked with Here Api to get a map and routing between 2 locations.

## Challenges we faced

Making the route between start and end location show on the map was definitely a challenge as we learned the Here api. Also, getting the server to match people based on desired route and location took most of our time to get to work.

## What we learned

Learned more about Node.js and using APIs in JavaScript

## What's next for Match My Ride

Adding driving directions, make match Spotify/Apple Music based. Adding more features for best experience!
